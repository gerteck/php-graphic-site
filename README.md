## How to serve the Site in XAMPP

## Download XAMPP

To get started, you need to download and install XAMPP, which is an open-source web server solution package that includes Apache, MariaDB (MySQL), PHP, and Perl. XAMPP is the most popular PHP development environment.

1. Visit the [Apache Friends website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Download the XAMPP installer for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or OS X).

## Install XAMPP

1. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.
2. It's recommended to keep the default installation directory (e.g., `C:\xampp` on Windows).

## Start Apache and MySQL

1. Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**.
2. Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services by clicking the "Start" buttons next to them.

Once started, the server will be running on `http://localhost/` and can serve your PHP website.

## Set Up Your PHP Project

1. Navigate to the `htdocs` directory inside the XAMPP installation folder (`C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows).
2. Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `my_php_project`).
3. Place your PHP files, such as `index.php`, into this folder.

For example, if you have the following code:

```php
<?php include 'includes/header.php'; ?>

<h1>Welcome to My PHP Website</h1>
<p>This is a simple PHP website.</p>

<?php include 'includes/footer.php'; ?>
```

## Access the Website in Your Browser

1. Open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome).
2. In the address bar, type `http://localhost/my_php_project` and press Enter.

Your website should now be displayed, and you should see the content of your PHP files.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure that Apache and MySQL are both running in the XAMPP Control Panel.
- Check that you saved your files in the correct directory (`htdocs`).
- Ensure you are accessing the correct URL in your browser (`http://localhost/my_php_project`).
